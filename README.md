# -ALT-V-Discord-Manager

Here is my discord manager under ALT: V.

At the moment, the following systems have been implemented:

Answers to reports - a convenient system of replies to player reports. Now the administration does not have to constantly be at its computer, it is enough to have a regular phone with a discord installed.

Plans:

- Whitelist system.
- The system of commands associated with the server.
- Server management system via Discord.

# Install

To install any of my script, you just need to place it in the appropriate section of your server (server and client), as well as install the necessary modules.

```js
npm i discord.js
```
